The Internet is a global computer network consisting of a web of inter-networks connecting large and small networks together
                                        AKA
A network of networks without a centralized owner

LAN can be characterized as internal network communications, for example home networks consisting of a modem/gateway along with
    a wireless access point connecting smart devices and allowing for intercommunication

LAN data is passed through to ISP in order to communicate with the larger available network.
An ISP is an aggregation of small network combined into a larger network that is maintained.
ISP networks often consist of many edge nodes that aggregate traffic to their core network
Internet exchange points, these are specialized ISP nodes, connects to other ISPs to pass traffic appropriately to destination

MDF (Main Distribution Frame): central location where servers are placed
IDF (Intermediate Distribution Frame): aggregated location closer to user (switches, servers)


Access Layer - switch ports users are connected to
    Distribution Layer - IDF
        Core Layer - MDF

IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service): Hyper-data center -- typically arranged as a multistage clos network

Clos Theorem: If k >= 2n-1, then a new connection can always be added without rearrangement


How can we reduce network latency? One solution would be to reduce the number of networks the end-user requests traverse through.
    Try to connect as closely as possible to the end user -- aka meet the user at an edge data center --> edge centers located near ISP central locations
