The OSI model is a conceptual model that componentizes telecommunication functions into 7 layers


7. Application Layer - Data - High-level APIs, resource sharing, remote file access
6. Presentation Layer - Data - Translation of data between a networking service and an application
    (character encoding, data compression, encryption/decryption)
5. Session Layer - Data - Managing session communications
4. Transport Layer - TCP/UDP - Reliable transmission of data sefments between point on a network
3. Network Layer - Packet - Structuring and managing a multi-node network like addressing routing and traffic control
2. Data Link Layer - Frame - Reliable transmission of data frames between two nodes connected by a physical layer
1. Physical Layer - Bit - Transmission and reception of raw bit streams
